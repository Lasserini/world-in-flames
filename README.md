## 1. User Experience (UX)

### 1.1 Project introduction
World In Flames takes the classic Hangman game and combines it with a Climate Crisis theme. The user is cast as the hero and is tasked with saving humanity. To do so the user has to guess the correct word before running out of attempts. The words focus around activities that impact peoples climate footprint, in particular the everyday aspects that people could choose to act upon. 
When the user succeeds or fails, the user is meet by an end screen with provides some brief information about the word that was the answer, and provided with ways to further explore their own part of combating climate change.

### 1.2 Project goals
- Create a Hangman Game using Javascript.
- Add a climate crises theme that makes for an interesting game experience.
- Nudge the user towards seeking further information about their personal climate footprint.

### 1.3 Target audience
The website is aimed at people who enjoy quick games, its intended to be lighthearted enough to provide a fun experience, but also has a more serious backdrop to which it hopes cast some attention to.<br>
The website targets people who want to be a part of changing the climate crisis we are currently in, but feel helpless or are unaware of where to begin.

### 1.5 Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The site has a gloomy thematic setting, and is therefor designed with a dark theme. The main colours are black backgrounds, intended to make the burning effects on the images stand out clearer, red text on highlighted headings and white text for larger blocks of text.

-   #### Typography
    -   The Raleway font is the main font used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Raleway isn't being imported into the site correctly. Oswald is used for headings, also with Sand Serif as fallback. 

-   #### Images
    -   Imagery plays a crucial role. The startscreen features a hero image which displays a burnin globe being held by human hands, intended to symbolise the tast the user is presented with.
    -   The actual game uses images that see the world in a gradually more deteriorated state (using imagery rather than the classic hangman animation).
    -   The conclusion also uses images to encite an emotional response, either showing an exploding planet upon failure or a healthier planet upon succes.
