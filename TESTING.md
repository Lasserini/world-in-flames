- The 14 warnings relate to using newer JavaScript stuff. They are mostly warnings about using "let" to declare variables, and then some comments about using a few instances of template literals & arrow function syntax.

## 5. Known Bugs
- On devices with a viewport height below 600px there was an issue with the dropdown navigation menu. The menu was locked in place & didn't scale, which caused an issue on the very smallest of phones. Bugfix: Applied a change that makes the menu list items scale with viewport height.
- There was a validation issue on the about me page. The problem was identified as headings being used inside a paragraph. Bugfix: A restructuring of the content box fixed the issue.
- The Contact Formular isn't working yet. The backend required will be added in a future update.
- The navigation menu was too large for midsize screens (i.e. 800px to 970px), using the small nav bar at such a large screensize felt off. So instead a solution with reduced font-size at that range of screens is applied.
