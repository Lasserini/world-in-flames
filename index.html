            <h2>A Timely Hero</h2>
            <p>For centuries the human race tormented their beloved planet earth.
                By the year 2000 the earths climate began to change,
                temperatures started rising and delicate weather systems changed drastically.
                <br><br>
                "It's probably not because of us", the humans thought,
                lets keep burning an ever increasing amount of fossile fuels!
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to today; the climate crisis is escalating rapidly,
                human activity is widely agreed upon as the primary cause.
                <br><br>
                Yet no one acts! What can you do? You're just one out of billions.
                The human race desperately needs a hero!
                Will you be the timely hero humanity needs?
                <br><br>
                Failure is not an option!
            </p>
